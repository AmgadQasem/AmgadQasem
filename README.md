## Hi there! 👋

I’m Amgad Qasem, a passionate developer with a love for creating innovative solutions. Whether it’s building web applications or developing mobile apps, I’m always eager to learn, explore new technologies, and grow in my journey as a mobile and web developer.

## About Me

I am currently exploring the world of programming and development. I enjoy working with Dart, Flutter, and HTML, and I have experience in building web applications using CSS and Bootstrap. I am also expanding my skills in Laravel, Firebase, and Supabase to build robust full-stack solutions. While I am still growing my profile, I am enthusiastic about collaborating with others and learning from the tech community to enhance my development journey.
