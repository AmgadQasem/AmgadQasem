👋 Hi there!

I’m Amgad Qasem, a passionate Flutter Developer focused on building seamless, high-performance mobile applications. I love transforming ideas into real apps with clean UI, smooth animations, and scalable architectures.

🚀 About Me

I specialize in cross-platform mobile development using Flutter.
I enjoy working with Dart, managing app state using tools like Provider, Bloc, and GetX, and integrating powerful backend services such as Firebase and Supabase.

I’m continuously learning and improving—whether it's architecture patterns, performance optimization, or crafting beautiful user interfaces. I’m excited to collaborate, build impactful apps, and grow within the Flutter community.
